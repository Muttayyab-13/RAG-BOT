# RAG Bot - Viral Content Analysis Assistant

A custom Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that analyzes documents and viral video content (e.g., TikTok/Instagram) to answer questions and extract high-engagement insights using open-source embeddings and LangChain.

## üöÄ What It Does

This RAG bot:
- Accepts your PDF/TXT files or scraped content (e.g., captions, hashtags, comments)
- Embeds them using **open-source sentence transformers**
- Allows you to ask questions like:
  - "What makes this video go viral?"
  - "What emotions or hooks were used?"
  - "Which clips had ridiculous endings?"
- Returns GPT-generated responses **based on actual content**, not hallucinations.
